# Spotify Stats Prototype
This web app was created for my UX final project (Fall 2023). Future plans are to turn this into a fully functional web app for everyone to use. 

Intended for mobile use only. Download as a standalone app for best experience (below).

   Open the website in your preferred browser (Chrome, Safari, or Edge).

2. **Access the Options Menu:**  
   - **For Android (Chrome or Edge):** Tap the three-dot menu (`â‹®`) in the top-right corner.
